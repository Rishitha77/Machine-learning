Classifiaction of SVHN data using CNN.

Utilized Neural Networks and Deep Learning architecture and built a Convolution Neural Network for recognizing the digits in the SVHN dataset which contains real world printed digits cropped from the house plate pictures

Achieved an overall test accuracy of 92.34%.
